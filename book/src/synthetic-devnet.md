# Synthetic Devnet

This repository includes an in-repo Polkadot SDK runtime under `runtime/` and a
matching synthetic index-spec renderer in `src/synthetic_devnet.rs`.

The synthetic stack exists to test and benchmark the real indexer against a
deterministic local chain without depending on external networks.

## Stack Layers

1. `runtime/` builds a small runtime WASM
2. `polkadot-omni-node` runs that runtime locally
3. `src/synthetic_devnet.rs` renders the matching index spec
4. `seed_synthetic_runtime` writes deterministic on-chain data
5. Acuity Index indexes the chain normally and is validated through its public API

The synthetic runtime includes GRANDPA so finalized indexing and proof responses
can be exercised locally.

## Useful Commands

Start a local dev node:

```bash
just synthetic-node
```

Seed a small smoke dataset:

```bash
just seed-smoke
```

Run the node-backed integration suite:

```bash
just test-integration
```

The ignored integration suite covers both ordinary `GetEvents` queries and
proof-oriented requests using `includeProofs`.
